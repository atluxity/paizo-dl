# Paizo Digital Asset Downloader

This Python script allows you to automate the process of downloading digital assets from Paizo.com. It handles logging in, asset personalization, and downloading all available digital content, including PDFs and ZIP files. It also supports retrying failed downloads and properly naming downloaded files, avoiding overwrites.

## Features

- **Asset Listing**: Lists all available assets and allows you to choose which assets to download.
- **Personalization**: Automates the asset personalization process before downloading.
- **Dynamic File Naming**: Ensures that files are saved with unique names, appending numbers to filenames if necessary.
- **ZIP Extraction**: Automatically unzips downloaded ZIP files and renames their contents.
- **Error Handling**: Retries downloads up to 3 times in case of errors.
- **Debug Output**: Provides detailed information during the download process for troubleshooting.

## Configuration

### Cookies

The script uses session cookies to log into Paizo.
First open your browser, navigate to paizo.com, authenticate
Use web developer tools to grab the sessionID cookie
Put it in the source code.
Repeat with any other cookie for good measure.
Keep the browser window open, if script cant load assets recheck that the browser is still logged in

### Credentials

Line 35 in the code, where you configure the COOKIES, put a working sessionID.

## Known Issues

- Auth could be handled better... A bit ugly to use SessionID like this
- Some assets may require multiple retries due to server-side delays in personalization. The script will retry downloads up to 3 times.
- If the paizo.com website ever changes, even slightly, this script will probably break. Its a whack a mole game. Good luck.
